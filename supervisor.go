// SupervisorDirective defines the supervisor directive
//
// It represents the action that a supervisor can take when an entity fails or panics
// during message processing. Each directive corresponds to a specific recovery behavior:
//
//   - StopDirective: Instructs the supervisor to stop the failing actor.
//     allowing it to continue processing messages (typically used for recoverable errors).
//   - RestartDirective: Instructs the supervisor to restart the failing actor, reinitializing its state.
type SupervisorDirective int

const (
	// StopDirective indicates that when an entity fails, the supervisor should immediately stop
	// the entity. This directive is typically used when a failure is deemed irrecoverable
	// or when the entity's state cannot be safely resumed.
	StopDirective SupervisorDirective = iota

	// RestartDirective indicates that when an entity fails, the supervisor should restart the entity.
	// Restarting involves stopping the current instance and creating a new one, effectively resetting
	// the entity's internal state.
