## [v4.1.2] - 2026-04-26

### 🚀 New Features

- **`Engine.ActorSystem()` Accessor** — Added `Engine.ActorSystem()` to expose the underlying `goakt.ActorSystem`
  powering the engine. Returns `nil` before `Start` and after `Stop`. Intended for callers that need direct access to
  actor-system primitives — for example, spawning auxiliary actors alongside ego entities or inspecting cluster
  topology — without having to wire the actor system separately. The returned reference is a snapshot and should not
  be retained across engine restarts. See [engine.go](engine.go).

### 🧹 Improvements

- **Lock-Free Hot Read Paths** — To make the new accessor safe for concurrent use, the underlying `goakt.ActorSystem`
  and its `NoSender` PID are now bundled in a single `atomic.Pointer[actorSystemRef]` and published atomically by
  `Start`. All hot read paths (`AddProjection`, `RemoveProjection`, `IsProjectionRunning`, `Entity`, `EntityExists`,
  `DurableStateEntity`, `SendCommand`, `Saga`, `SagaStatus`) now load the reference with a single atomic load instead
  of taking a mutex. `Stop` swaps the reference to `nil` so callers racing with shutdown fail fast with
  `ErrEngineNotStarted` rather than operating on a system in mid-teardown.
- **`RWMutex` for Remaining Snapshot Reads** — The engine mutex has been promoted from `sync.Mutex` to `sync.RWMutex`.
  The remaining field-snapshot reads (`offsetStore`, `eventStream`, `stateStore`, `eventsStore`, `snapshotStore`)
  acquire it via `RLock`, allowing concurrent readers. Writers (`AddEventPublishers`, `AddStatePublishers`) keep the
  exclusive `Lock`.
- **Test Coverage** — Added `TestActorSystem` covering the unstarted, started, stopped, and concurrent-reader cases
  (the latter exercised under `-race`), and `TestActorSystemRefGuard` exercising the defensive `ErrEngineNotStarted`
  branch on every hot read path.

## [v4.1.1] - 2026-04-18

### 🚀 New Features

- **Entity Existence Probe** — Added `Engine.EntityExists(ctx, entityID)` to check whether an entity is currently alive
  in the cluster without spawning it or replaying its journal. Works for both event-sourced and durable state entities,
  and is intended as a lightweight liveness check for callers that need to branch on entity presence without paying the
  cost of materialization. See [engine.go](engine.go).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Projection Lag Computation** — Fixed `Engine.ProjectionLag` to correctly compute the per-shard delta between the
  newest persisted event and the projection's committed offset. The result is now clamped at zero so a projection
  running ahead of the probe window is no longer reported as negative, and the implementation documents the
  unit (seconds) and bounded-scan trade-off used to locate the latest event in a shard. See [engine.go](engine.go).

### 🧹 Improvements

- Added `SECURITY.md` describing the project's security analysis and disclosure process.

## [v4.1.0] - 2026-04-02

### 🚀 New Features

- **Event Batching** — Accumulate events from multiple commands and flush them in a single store write, amortizing
  persistence cost under concurrent load. Two new spawn options control batching:
  - `WithBatchThreshold(n)` — flush after `n` accumulated events (0 disables batching, which is the default)
  - `WithBatchFlushWindow(d)` — flush after duration `d`, whichever comes first
  While a batch is being written, the actor stashes incoming commands and replays them after the write completes.

- **Benchmark Suite** — Added a comprehensive benchmark suite (`benchmark/`) measuring throughput, latency percentiles
  (p50/p90/p95/p99), heap usage, and GC cycles across sequential, parallel, batched, and unbatched workloads with
  simulated I/O latencies.

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

- **Async Persistence Pipeline** — Restructured event-sourced entity persistence into three specialized child actors:
  - `EventsWriterActor` — synchronous (Ask) event persistence and publishing; correctness requires write confirmation
  - `SnapshotsWriterActor` — asynchronous (Tell) snapshot persistence with encryption and exponential-backoff retry
  - `EventsJanitorActor` — asynchronous (Tell) retention policy enforcement after snapshot writes
  Snapshots and retention no longer block command processing, eliminating the primary synchronous bottleneck.

- **Batch Event Tracking** — Batch threshold now counts accumulated events rather than commands, correctly handling
  commands that produce multiple events.

### 🧹 Improvements

- Added retry utility (`retry.go`) with exponential backoff and jitter (up to 3 retries, capped at 2s) for async
  persistence operations
- Added Performance Tuning section to README covering batch threshold selection, snapshot configuration, retention
  policies, allocation optimization, and horizontal scaling guidance
- Added Persistence Stores section to README documenting ego-contrib store implementations (Postgres, MongoDB)
- Refreshed README header layout and removed emojis from section headings
- Comprehensive test coverage for events writer, snapshots writer, and events janitor actors
- Added batch trace assertion tests
- Excluded benchmark tests from code coverage metrics
- Updated publisher modules to ego v4.0.0

## [v4.0.0] - 2026-03-21

### 🚀 New Features

- **📸 Snapshot Store** — Introduced a dedicated `SnapshotStore` interface (`persistence/snapshot_store.go`) for
  persisting entity state snapshots independently from events. This decouples state recovery from event replay,
  significantly improving recovery performance for entities with long event histories. Configurable via
  `WithSnapshotStore()` engine option and `WithSnapshotInterval()` spawn option.

- **🔄 Event Adapters (Schema Evolution)** — Added the `eventadapter` package with an `EventAdapter` interface and a
  `Chain()` function for composing adapters. Event adapters transform persisted events from older schema versions into
  the current shape during replay and projection consumption, enabling seamless event schema evolution without rewriting
  stored data.

- **📊 OpenTelemetry Integration** — First-class observability via the new `Telemetry` struct and `WithTelemetry()`
  engine option. Includes:
  - Trace spans on command processing (`ego.command`) with `ego.persistence_id` and `ego.command_type` attributes
  - Metrics:
    - `ego.commands.total` (counter) — total number of commands processed
    - `ego.commands.duration` (histogram, ms) — command processing latency
    - `ego.events.persisted` (counter) — total number of events persisted
    - `ego.projection.events.processed` (counter) — total events processed by projections
    - `ego.entities.active` (up/down counter) — number of currently active entities
    - `ego.projections.active` (up/down counter) — number of currently active projections

- **💀 Dead Letter Handler** — Added the `DeadLetterHandler` interface (`projection/deadletter.go`) for receiving events
  that a projection failed to process after exhausting its recovery policy. Includes a `DiscardDeadLetterHandler` as the
  default no-op implementation. Configurable via `WithProjection()`.

- **🔁 Projection Rebuild** — New `Engine.RebuildProjection(ctx, name, from)` API method that stops a running projection,
  resets its offset to a given timestamp, and restarts it. Enables re-processing events from any point in time.

- **🧪 Testkit Scenarios** — Fluent Given/When/Then API for testing behaviors without starting an engine:
  - `EventSourcedScenario` — `Given(events...)`, `When(command)`, then assert with `ThenEvents()`, `ThenState()`,
      `ThenError()`, or `ThenNoEvents()`
  - `DurableStateScenario` — `Given(state, version)`, `When(command)`, then assert with `ThenState()`,
      `ThenVersion()`, or `ThenError()`

- **🔀 Migration Utility** — One-time `Migrator` (`migration/`) that reads legacy events (which embedded
  `resulting_state` at proto field 5) and extracts that state into the new `SnapshotStore`. Supports configurable page
  size and logging. Idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

- **📈 Projection Lag Monitoring** — Operators can now observe how far behind each projection is relative to the latest
  events in the store. Includes:
  - New metrics:
    - `ego.projection.lag_ms` (gauge, ms) — per-projection, per-shard lag
    - `ego.projection.latest_offset` (gauge, ms) — current projection offset timestamp per shard
    - `ego.projection.events_behind` (gauge) — approximate number of unprocessed events per shard
  - New `Engine.ProjectionLag(ctx, projectionName)` API returning per-shard lag as `map[uint64]time.Duration`

- **🗑️ Snapshot/Event Retention Policies** — Automatic cleanup of old events and snapshots after a snapshot has been
  successfully written, preventing unbounded storage growth. Configurable via `WithRetentionPolicy()` spawn option with:
  - `DeleteEventsOnSnapshot` — delete events up to the snapshot sequence number
  - `DeleteSnapshotsOnSnapshot` — delete older snapshots, keeping only the latest
  - `EventsRetentionCount` — number of events to retain before the snapshot point as a safety margin

- **🔐 Event Encryption / GDPR Support** — Transparent encryption of event and snapshot payloads at rest with
  crypto-shredding support for GDPR "right to erasure". Includes:
  - New `encryption` package with `Encryptor` and `KeyStore` interfaces
  - Default AES-256-GCM implementation (`encryption.AESEncryptor`)
  - New `encryption_key_id` and `is_encrypted` fields on `Event` and `Snapshot` protobuf messages
  - Events encrypted before persistence, decrypted during entity recovery and projection consumption
  - `Engine.EraseEntity(ctx, persistenceID, full)` API for GDPR erasure (physical deletion of events/snapshots)
  - `WithEncryptor()` engine option to enable encryption
  - In-memory `testkit.KeyStore` for testing

- **📝 Pluggable Logger Interface** — Introduced a minimal `Logger` interface (`logger.go`) that lets developers plug in
  any logging backend (zap, zerolog, slog, logrus, etc.). Methods follow the slog convention with structured key-value
  pairs. The engine now stores `Logger` directly and wraps it via `loggerAdapter` when passing to the underlying actor
  system. Includes:
  - `Logger` interface with `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error` methods
  - Optional `LeveledLogger` interface for engine-side log gating
  - `DiscardLogger` — exported no-op logger for tests or silent operation
  - Default `slog`-based logger used when no logger is explicitly configured
  - `WithLogger()` engine option now accepts `Logger` instead of `log.Logger`

- **🔄 Saga/Process Manager** — First-class abstraction for long-running business processes that coordinate multiple
  entities with compensation logic for rollback on failures. Includes:
  - `SagaBehavior` interface with `HandleEvent`, `HandleResult`, `HandleError`, `ApplyEvent`, and `Compensate` methods
  - `SagaAction` type for declaring commands to send, events to persist, and completion/compensation signals
  - `SagaCommand` type for targeting commands to specific entities with configurable timeouts
  - Event-sourced saga actor that subscribes to the event stream, persists its own events, and recovers after restarts
  - `Engine.Saga(ctx, behavior, timeout)` API to start a saga
  - `Engine.SagaStatus(ctx, sagaID, timeout)` API to query saga state
  - Automatic compensation on timeout

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- **📦 Module Path** — Module path changed from `github.com/tochemey/ego/v3` to `github.com/tochemey/ego/v4`. All import
  paths must be updated.

- **🗃️ Event Proto Schema** — The `resulting_state` field (field 5) has been **removed** from the `Event` protobuf
  message and marked as reserved. Events are now "pure" — they no longer carry inline entity state. State is managed
  separately via the new Snapshot Store.

- **📐 Projection Handler Signature** — `projection.Handler.Handle()` signature changed: the `state *anypb.Any` parameter
  has been removed.
  - **Before:** `Handle(ctx, persistenceID, event, state, revision)`
  - **After:** `Handle(ctx, persistenceID, event, revision)`

- **🔧 Event-Sourced Recovery Rewrite** — Entity recovery no longer reads state from the latest event's
  `resulting_state`. Recovery now loads the latest snapshot (if available) and replays only subsequent events, applying
  event adapters in the chain.

- **📝 Logger Interface** — `WithLogger()` now accepts `ego.Logger` instead of `goakt/log.Logger`. Callers that
  previously passed a GoAkt logger (e.g. `log.DiscardLogger`) must switch to the new `ego.Logger` interface (e.g.
  `ego.DiscardLogger`). The engine's internal logging calls use `Logger.Debug/Info/Warn/Error` instead of `Debugf/Infof`.

- **🏗️ Internal Extension Constructors** — `extensions.NewProjectionExtension()` now requires an additional
  `DeadLetterHandler` parameter.

- **🏗️ EventSourcedActor Constructor** — `newEventSourcedActor()` no longer accepts arguments. Per-entity
  configuration (snapshot interval, retention policy) is now passed via the `extensions.EntityConfig` dependency,
  ensuring correct behavior during cluster relocation.

- **🌐 Cluster discovery API** — `WithCluster()` now accepts `ego.ClusterProvider` instead of GoAkt’s
  `discovery.Provider`. The engine wraps your implementation when wiring the actor system, so application code no longer
  depends on GoAkt’s discovery package for this option. Implement `ClusterProvider` (`ID`, `Start`, `DiscoverPeers`,
  `Stop`) or add a thin adapter around a GoAkt discovery implementation if you still use one.

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- **Go OpenTelemetry** — `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`, `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric`, and
  `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` v1.42.0 promoted from indirect to direct dependencies
- **Publisher modules** (Kafka, NATS, Pulsar, WebSocket) — Import paths updated to v4; no functional changes

### 🧹 Improvements

- **Event proto** — Added `encryption_key_id` and `is_encrypted` fields to `Event` and `Snapshot` protobuf messages
- **Event-sourced actor** — Snapshot-based recovery with configurable intervals reduces event replay overhead
- **Event-sourced actor** — Retention policy cleanup runs after snapshot write, deleting old events and snapshots
- **Event-sourced actor** — Transparent encrypt/decrypt of event and snapshot payloads when an encryptor is configured
- **Projection runner** — Event adapters applied during projection consumption; dead letter forwarding on `RetryAndSkip`
  and `Skip` recovery policies
- **Durable state actor** — Added OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics on command processing
- **Test coverage** — Added `internal/extensions/extensions_test.go` and comprehensive tests for all new packages
- **Testkit** — Added in-memory `SnapshotStore` implementation (`testkit/snapshotstore.go`) for testing
- **Testkit** — Added in-memory `KeyStore` implementation (`testkit/keystore.go`) for encryption testing
- **Projection runner** — Decrypts encrypted events before handing them to the handler and event adapters
- **Projection runner** — Records per-shard lag, offset, and events-behind metrics when telemetry is enabled
- **Clustering** — `ClusterProvider` documentation aligned with engine lifecycle; peer discovery is configured only
  through ego’s `ClusterProvider` surface (no direct `discovery.Provider` on `WithCluster`)

### 📖 Migration Guide

To upgrade from v3 to v4:

1. **Update import paths** — Replace all `github.com/tochemey/ego/v3` imports with `github.com/tochemey/ego/v4`
2. **Update projection handlers** — Remove the `state *anypb.Any` parameter from your `Handle()` implementations
3. **Run the migration utility** — Use `migration.NewMigrator()` to extract inline state from legacy events into the new
   snapshot store
4. **Configure a snapshot store** — Pass a `SnapshotStore` implementation via `WithSnapshotStore()` for optimal recovery
   performance
5. **Update logger usage** — Replace `WithLogger(log.DiscardLogger)` or any `goakt/log.Logger` value with an
   `ego.Logger` implementation (e.g. `ego.DiscardLogger`). If you have a custom GoAkt logger, wrap it in the new
   `Logger` interface instead
6. **Regenerate protobuf** — If you depend on the `Event` message directly, regenerate from the updated `.proto` files
7. **Cluster mode** — Replace `WithCluster(goaktDiscoveryProvider, ...)` with `WithCluster(ego.ClusterProvider, ...)`.
   Map GoAkt’s `Initialize`/`Close` to `Start`/`Stop`, and `DiscoverPeers()` to `DiscoverPeers(ctx)`; `Register`/`Deregister`
   can be no-ops if your backend folds them into start/stop
