eGo is a minimal library that help build event-sourcing and CQRS application through a simple interface, and it allows
developers to describe their **_commands_**, **_events_** and **_states_** _**are defined using google protocol buffers**_
.
Under the hood, ego leverages [Go-Akt](https://github.com/Tochemey/goakt) to scale out and guarantee performant,
reliable persistence.

## üíª Installation

```bash
go get github.com/tochemey/ego/v3
```

## üî¢ Versioning

The version system adopted in eGo deviates a bit from the standard semantic versioning system.
The version format is as follows:

- The `MAJOR` part of the version will stay at `v3` for the meantime.
- The `MINOR` part of the version will cater for any new _features_, _breaking changes_  with a note on the breaking
  changes.
- The `PATCH` part of the version will cater for dependencies upgrades, bug fixes, security patches and co.

The versioning will remain like `v3.x.x` until further notice. The current version is **`v3.4.0`**

## üì¶ Binaries and Minimum Go Versions

| From     | To       | Minimum Go Version |  
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| `v3.3.2` | `v3.4.0` | `1.23.0`           |
| `v2.0.2` | `v3.3.2` | `1.22.0`           |
| `v1.1.3` | `v2.0.1` | `1.21.0`           |
| `v1.0.0` | `v1.1.2` | `1.20.0`           |

## ‚ú® Features

### Event Sourced Behavior

The [`EventSourcedBehavior`](./behavior.go) is crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially in distributed
systems. It defines how to handle the various commands (requests to perform actions) that are always directed at the
event sourced entity.
In eGo commands sent to the [`EventSourcedBehavior`](./behavior.go) are processed in order. When a command is processed,
it may result in the generation of events, which are then stored in an event store. Every event persisted has a revision
number
and timestamp that can help track it. The [`EventSourcedBehavior`](./behavior.go) in eGo is responsible for defining how
to handle events that are the result of command handlers.
The end result of events handling is to build the new state of the event sourced entity. When running in cluster mode,
aggregate root are sharded.

- `Commands handler`: The command handlers define how to handle each incoming command,
  which validations must be applied, and finally, which events will be persisted if any. When there is no event to be
  persisted a nil can
  be returned as a no-op. Command handlers are the meat of the event sourced actor.
  They encode the business rules of your event sourced actor and act as a guardian of the event sourced entity
  consistency.
  The command handler must first validate that the incoming command can be applied to the current model state.
  Any decision should be solely based on the data passed in the commands and the state of the Behavior.
  In case of successful validation, one or more events expressing the mutations are persisted. Once the events are
  persisted, they are applied to the state producing a new valid state.
- `Events handler`: The event handlers are used to mutate the state of the event sourced entity by applying the events
  to it.
  Event handlers must be pure functions as they will be used when instantiating the event sourced entity and replaying
  the event store.

#### Howto

To define an event sourced entity, one needs to:

1. define the state of the event sourced entity using google protocol buffers message
2. define the various commands that will be handled by the event sourced entity
3. define the various events that are result of the command handlers and that will be handled by the event sourced
   entity to return the new state of the event sourced entity
4. define and make sure the [`events store`](./persistence/events_store.go) is properly implemented.
5. implement the [`EventSourcedBehavior`](./behavior.go) interface.
6. call the `Entity` method of eGo [engine](./engine.go)

#### Events Stream

Every event handled by event sourced entity are pushed to an events stream. That enables real-time processing of events
without having to interact with the events store.
Just use `Subscribe` method of [Engine](./engine.go) and start iterating through the messages and cast every message to
the [Event](./protos/ego/v3/ego.proto).

#### Projection

One can add a projection to the eGo engine to help build a read model. Projections in eGo rely on an [offset store](#offsets-store) to
track how far they have consumed events
persisted by the write model. The offset used in eGo is a _timestamp-based offset_. One can also:

- remove a given projection: this will stop the projection and remove it from the system
- check the status of a given projection

#### Events Store

One can implement a custom events store. See [EventsStore](persistence/events_store.go).
There are some pre-built events stores one can use out of the box. See [Contrib](https://github.com/Tochemey/ego-contrib/tree/main/eventstore)

#### Offsets Store

One can implement a custom offsets store. See [OffsetStore](./offsetstore/iface.go).
There are some pre-built offsets stores one can use out of the box. See [Contrib](https://github.com/Tochemey/ego-contrib/tree/main/offsetstore)

### Durable State Behavior

The [`DurableStateBehavior`](./behavior.go) represents a type of Actor that persists its full state after processing
each command instead of using event sourcing.
This type of Actor keeps its current state in memory during command handling and based upon the command response
persists its full state into a durable store. The store can be a SQL or NoSQL database.
The whole concept is given the current state of the actor and a command produce a new state with a higher version as
shown in this diagram: (State, Command) => State
[`DurableStateBehavior`](./behavior.go) reacts to commands which result in a new version of the actor state. Only the
latest version of the actor state is persisted to the durable store.
There is no concept of history regarding the actor state since this is not an event sourced actor.
However, one can rely on the _version number_ of the actor state and exactly know how the actor state has evolved
overtime.
[`DurableStateBehavior`](./behavior.go) version number are numerically incremented by the command handler which means it
is imperative that the newer version of the state is greater than the current version by one.
[`DurableStateBehavior`](./behavior.go) will attempt to recover its state whenever available from the durable state.
During a normal shutdown process, it will persist its current state to the durable store prior to shutting down. This
behavior help maintain some consistency across the actor state evolution.

#### Durable Store

One can implement a custom state store. See [Durable Store](persistence/state_store.go).
There are some pre-built durable stores one can use out of the box. See [Contrib](https://github.com/Tochemey/ego-contrib/tree/main/durablestore)

#### Howto

To define a durable state entity, one needs to:

1. define the state of the entity using google protocol buffers message
2. define the various commands that will be handled by the entity
3. define and make sure the [`durable state store`](./persistence/state_store.go) is properly implemented.
4. implements the [`DurableStateBehavior`](./behavior.go) interface
5. start eGo engine with the option durable store using `WithStateStore`
6. call the `DurableStateEntity` method of eGo [engine](./engine.go)

#### Events Stream

[`DurableStateBehavior`](./behavior.go) full state is pushed to an events stream.
That enables real-time processing of state without having to interact with the state store.
Just use `Subscribe` method of [Engine](./engine.go) and start iterating through the messages and cast every message to
the [DurableState](./protos/ego/v3/ego.proto).

### Publishers

eGo offers the following publisher APIs:

* [EventPublisher](./publisher.go) - publishes `EventSourcedBehavior` events to any streaming platform
* [StatePublisher](./publisher.go) - publishes `DurableStateBehavior` state to any streaming platform

The following streaming connectors are implemented out of the box:

* [Kafka](./publisher/kafka)
* [Pulsar](./publisher/pulsar)
* [NATs](./publisher/nats)
* [Websocket](./publisher/websocket)

## üåê Cluster

The cluster mode heavily relies on [Go-Akt](https://github.com/Tochemey/goakt#clustering) clustering. To enable clustering one need to use `WithCluster` option
when creating the eGo engine.

## üß™ Testkit

eGo comes bundle with in-memory datastore that can be found in the [testkit](./testkit) package. This can help play with eGo.

## üèóÔ∏è Mocks

eGo ships in some [mocks](./mocks) that can help mock the data stores for unit tests purpose.

## üéØ Examples
