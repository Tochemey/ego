	// which validations must be applied, and finally, which events will be persisted if any. When there is no event to be persisted a nil can
	// be returned as a no-op. Command handlers are the meat of the event sourced actor.
	// They encode the business rules of your event sourced actor and act as a guardian of the event sourced actor consistency.
	// The command eventSourcedHandler must first validate that the incoming command can be applied to the current model state.
	//  Any decision should be solely based on the data passed in the commands and the state of the Behavior.
	// In case of successful validation, one or more events expressing the mutations are persisted.
	// Once the events are persisted, they are applied to the state producing a new valid state.
	HandleCommand(ctx context.Context, command Command, priorState T) (event Event, err error)
	// HandleEvent handle events emitted by the command handlers. The event handlers are used to mutate the state of the event sourced actor by applying the events to it.
	// Event handlers must be pure functions as they will be used when instantiating the event sourced actor and replaying the event journal.
