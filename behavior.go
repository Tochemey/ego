	// It is at the discretion of the application developer to know in which order a given command should return the list of events

// DurableStateBehavior represents a type of Actor that persists its full state after processing each command instead of using event sourcing.
// This type of Actor keeps its current state in memory during command handling and based upon the command response
// persists its full state into a durable store. The store can be a SQL or NoSQL database.
// The whole concept is given the current state of the actor and a command produce a new state with a higher version as shown in this diagram: (State, Command) => State
// DurableStateBehavior reacts to commands which result in a new version of the actor state. Only the latest version of the actor state is
// persisted to the durable store. There is no concept of history regarding the actor state since this is not an event sourced actor.
// However, one can rely on the version number of the actor state and exactly know how the actor state has evolved overtime.
// State actor version number are numerically incremented by the command handler which means it is imperative that the newer version of the state is greater than the current version by one.
//
// DurableStateBehavior will attempt to recover its state whenever available from the durable state.
// During a normal shutdown process, it will persist its current state to the durable store prior to shutting down.
// This behavior help maintain some consistency across the actor state evolution.
